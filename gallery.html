                <p> This was my first time working in p5.js, and it definitely showed. I partnered with Pam, who described an item they lost as a child. I ended up piecing together a big clue about what it was—a Blue's Clues plushie. I remember spending so much time trying to get everything in the right position, constantly tweaking and adjusting. It was a slow process, but looking back, it taught me a lot about patience and figuring things out step by step.  .</p>

                <p>My face generator was literally just a cat that changes face... although its horrible i t was one of my first few projects so i was still figuring out.</p>

                <p>The experimental clock I designed uses abstract shapes—circles, squares, and triangles—to represent hours, minutes, and seconds. Instead of traditional clock hands, these shapes orbit and rotate in response to mouse movement, creating a dynamic, interactive experience. The fluid transitions and pulsating shapes give the clock a "trippy" feel, making time appear kinetic and ever-changing.</p>
